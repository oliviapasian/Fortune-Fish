Hi! I used a few resources while working on this, which I credited throughout the js file but will add here all in one place as well:

1. Sound effect from nomiqbomi on freesound.org
https://freesound.org/people/nomiqbomi/sounds/578803/

2. Got the idea to format the dropdown selection to call a function of if statements from this p5 sketch:
https://editor.p5js.org/aferriss/sketches/SJtxrLp3M

3. Using p5 random function from reference:
https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random
And this p5 sketch, for getting random array elements:
https://editor.p5js.org/mbardin/sketches/wVe_dpmLO

4. Haven't used p5 text much before, so referred to this page in the p5 reference:
https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/text

5. I forgot how to use operators for a minute so used this W3Schools reference:
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp

And the rest was from class examples, my past labs, and just my own past knowledge of p5!
